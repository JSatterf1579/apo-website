\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Document Overview}
The \projName is a new website designed to replace the existing website.
The current website provides basic administrative features for some of the executive positions.
It also provides some basic features that allow brothers to keep in touch. However, each semester
more features are requested and the current website was not designed with future maintainability
in mind. For this reason this project seeks to make a new website that will provide better
administrative tools and better social tools. The goal is for the website to decrease the amount of effort
needed for administration and to get chapter members more involved in the organization. This document lays out
the design for the new website including the overall architecture, rationale for selected components and
services and the specifications of new components and services which must be created.

\subsection{Document Conventions}
This document references previous documents created for this project as well as documentation
for outside systems this system will interact with. References for the system can be found at the end of the document.
In text citations are listed as numbers in square brackets. For example ``[ 1 ]''.

\section{Design Overview}

\subsection{Architecture}

The basic architecture follows a design pattern for the website.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Multiple users connect to a webserver running our software and database via the Internet.
Setting up a webserver also requires setting up a Domain Name System (DNS) server and registering a domain
name.

The following subsections detail design decisions for each aspect of this general architecture.

\subsection{Webserver - Google App Engine}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:generalWebArchitecture} part of the architecture is the webserver which will run the actual application. There are two main options
for the webserver: buy a computer and configure it to be a webserver or use a hosting service. In the vision and scope document for this project
one of the assumptions was that the website will be hosted for free and that the website will be provided with a free
domain name. \cite{schwab_apo_2012} This rules out the buy and configure a webserver option. So it is necessary to select a free hosting service.

There are a multitude of free hosting services on the web, but the services vary in quality and not all packages
come with a free domain name. The free services are often limited in the amount of bandwidth and storage they can use.
Out of the surveyed hosting services with free packages Amazon EC2 offered the most amount of free bandwidth and storage. \cite{amazon_amazon_2012} \cite{heroku_heroku_2012} \cite{google_quotas_2012} However, using Amazon EC2 would require setup and configuration of a webserver and database server. In addition Amazon EC2's free tier is only free for the first year. After which the user must pay for all services.

On the other hand Google App Engine (GAE) has a free tier that does not expire. The amount of resources provided for free are not as high as Amazon's free tier, but the service will remain free for the foreseeable future.  \cite{google_quotas_2012} In addition GAE provides a free hostname by giving the application a subdomain of the appspot.com domain.
An additional benefit of GAE is that the free domain also comes with a free Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Certificate. An SSL 
certificate will be needed to provide secure login pages and to encrypt and authenticate sensitive information.

\subsection{Database - Google's Bigtable Datastore}

Another part of the architecture shown in figure \ref{fig:generalWebArchitecture} is the database. Traditional web
applications use a SQL based database such as MySQL. However, by choosing GAE as the hosting service the website
is restricted to using Google's Bigtable Datastore.

The advantage of this constraint is that the website's data is very unlikely to be lost due to Google's large number
of resources. In addition defining the schema for the Bigtable datastore is much easier than in a traditional SQL database.
This is because Bigtable is what is known as a ``NoSQL'' database. \cite{google_how_2012} ``NoSQL'' essentially means that the database does not have a traditional SQL schema. This means that instead of using tables like a traditional
SQL database Bigtable uses one ``big table'' that store what are known as ``Entities''. Entities are instances of a ``Model''. Models define the datatypes stored in an Entity as well as the requirements for each field. Models are defined in the code meaning that
the schema can easily be modified. Additionally the schema is automatically version controlled because it is defined in the
code that is already under version control. Models are also object oriented meaning that a base model can be defined and
generalized to more specific models. All of these properties make the Google's Bigtable more flexible than a traditional
database.

The one big disadvantage of Bigtable is that being a datastore type database there is no such thing as a JOIN operation. 
Instead any JOIN-like operation must be implemented by the developers.
