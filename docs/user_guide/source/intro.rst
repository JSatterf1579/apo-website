About
-----

This website was created to replace the old version of the Alpha Phi Omega Website located at apo.case.edu. There are many reasons that a new website is needed, but the main reason this project was started was to put in place a sturdy software base. The new code base is designed to be easier for beginners to contribute to. It is also designed to be more flexible than the previous codebase meaning that many settings that were previously hard coded are now configurable from administrative panels.

This website was built using Python 2.7 with the Flask, Jinja 2 and Werkzeug libraries. Please see flask.pocoo.org for more information.

The codebase is liscensed with the BSD 3-clause license.
