Chapter Service Events
======================

The Chapter Service Events section of the website allows
executive officers in the chapter to create, edit, and delete service
events. It also allows executive officers to approve or reject service
hours that have been submitted for review.

Creating a Service Event
------------------------

To create a service event navigate to the main Service Event page by
either clicking on the Service link in the main menu or going to
http://apo-cwru.appspot.com/service

Then simply click on the Create a Service Event link at the top of the
page. Fill out all of the information in the forms.

.. note::
   The format for the start and end time is the following "YYYY-MM-DD
   HH:MM:SS" so for example 7 am on 12/8/12 should be entered as
   "2012-12-08 07:00:00"

Editing a Service Event
-----------------------

To edit a service event simply go to that service event's page and
click the edit link, or click on the edit link next to the service
events name on the main service event page. Once you click on the link
you should be presented with the same form used to create a service
report. Just edit the information and click save to update the service event.

Deleting a Service Event
------------------------

To delete a service event either click the delete link next to the
event's name on the main service event's page or click the delete link
on that specific event's page.

.. warning::
   Deleting a service event will permanently delete it. It will also
   remove all associated service reports.

Reviewing Submitted Service Hours
---------------------------------

To review an event's service hours go to an event that has already
past. If the link says that service report has already been submitted
then click on that link. This will display all of the hours submitted
for each brother. Next to each submission will be an option to select
either pending, accepted or rejected. Select the appropriate option
for each submission and click save.
