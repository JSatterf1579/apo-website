Member Profiles
===============

Executive users of the chapter have the ability to not only edit their
own profile but anyone elses in the chapter. The edting works the
same way for users as it does for administrators. So for a general
guide please see the Member Profiles section in the End User part of
the manual.

However, executive members do get additional options on the main edit
page. These include setting a user's big, setting a user's family and
setting a user's role.

To set the user's big type in the Case ID of an existing member of the
chapter. To select a family simply select an option from the dropdown
menu. Multiple roles can be selected for a user. To clear a role that
is highlighted just click it. To select multiple roles hold down
control (command on Mac) while clicking on the roles.

To save everything just hit the save button.
