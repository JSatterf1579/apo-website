Chapter Service Events
======================

Service events are the main events of the chapter. A service event is
any officially endorsed event in which members perform community
service. Service events traditionally include community service events
such as helping at the Cleveland Foodbank and cleaning the Botanical
Gardens.

Service Event Listing
---------------------

To access the list of all service events either click on the Service
link in the main menu or go to http://apo-cwru.appspot.com/service

The main service event page includes two sections: future events and
past events. Next to each event is a view details link. Clicking the
link will bring the user to the details page for that event.

Service Event Detail Page
-------------------------

Each service event has a details page. The details page displays the
event name, additional event information, the start and end date-time,
and the location.

Additionally if an executive officer has configured this event so that
there is a cap on the number of brothers the total number of brothers
allowed will be displayed.

If this event has not past the start time and the number of brothers
currently signed up is below the cap on brothers a signup button will
appear. The user can click on this button to add themselves to the
list of users attending the event. Anytime before the event starts the
user can click the button again to remove themselves from the event.

Once the event has passed no more brothers will be allowed to sign
up. Instead of a signup button a link will be displayed to submit a
service report for the event. Clicking the link will bring the user to
the submit a service report page.

Service Report Submission
-------------------------

Clicking the submit service report link on a past event will bring the
user to this page. The page displays a form for each user that was
signed up for the event. The form allows the user to enter the number
of hours and minutes of community service the brother performed.

At the bottom of the page is a submit button. Upon clicking the submit
button the service report will be added to a list of pending
submissions. Once an exec member has approved each submitted hour the
user's contract status will be updated.

Service Report Status
---------------------

After a service report has been submitted the user can view the status
of the hours submitted. The three status types are pending, approved
and rejected. Pending means that the hours have not been reviewed,
approved means the hours have been applied to a users contract, and
rejected means that the hours have been reviewed and will not be
applied to the member's contract.
