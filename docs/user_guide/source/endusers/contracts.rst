Member Contracts
================

Member contracts allows a member to commit to a certain number of
service hours and a certain amount of membership dues. At the
beginning of each semester members will use this section of the
website to sign contracts. Then throughout the semester members will
be able to check their progress.

Contracts List
--------------

The main contracts page can be accessed from the Contracts link in the
main menu. On this page members can see an overview of the contract
types available. There is also a link to view the current progress of
any contract that a member may have signed.

Contract Details Page
---------------------

Clicking on the view details link next to a contract will bring the
user to the details page for that contract. On the page each
requirement along with its type and a description will be
displayed. If the user has not signed a contract then the user will be
shown a button allowing them to sign up.

Contract Progress Page
----------------------

Once a member has signed a contract from a contract details page the
member may check their contract progress via the check contract
progress link on the main contracts page.

On the contract progress page each requirement is shown along with due
dates, current progress, and the remaining time for the contract requirement.
