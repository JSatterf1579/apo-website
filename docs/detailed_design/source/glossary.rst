   decorator
     A special type of function in python that takes in a function
     reference and optionally other parameters. This function wraps
     the function with additional code that should be run whenever the
     function is executed. 

     Decorators go directly above the function name and are proceded
     by an `@` symbol. The first parameter is always the function
     reference and when using the `@` syntax this parameter doesn't
     need to be explicitly stated. The next function the interpreter
     encounters will be used.

        def my_decorator(fn, optional_argument):
	    # do something to the function here
	    pass
     
        @my_decorator(optional_argument)
	my_decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
