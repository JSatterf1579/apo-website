\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}

\indent\indent This document contains the software requirements for the \projName. This website
will be used by Case's Theta Upsilon chapter of the national service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega (APO).
The website will be accessible via the internet meaning people who are not members will be able to access
the website. In this case the website will simply act as a group of static pages providing basic information.
The actual functionality of the website will be for general members (known as brothers), people currently joining (known as pledges) and members that are elected and appointed to run the chapter (known as exec members).

The requirements in the this document are designed to produce a system that will increase brother interest
in the chapter as well as to decrease the amount of time spent administering the chapter. Additional benefits will
potentially include more transparency and accountability between elected members and general members.

The chapter currently has a website located at http://apo.case.edu, however, based on a survey of members within
the chapter there have been numerous complaints and feature requests. The previous website was built many years ago
and has been maintained by many different people over the years. The updates and fixes to the code base have varied in
quality. This has lead to a difficult to maintain code base. For this reason a new website is being designed with the new
requested features in mind. Many of the requirements in this document have been derived either from the functionality
of the previous website or from feature requests directly from members of the chapter.

\subsection{Scope}

This requirements document deals only with requirements for the \projName. The \projName \,may interface with
other outside pieces of software. In this case the requirements attempt to specify the functionality the outside service has
while remaining general so that outside services can be switched out.

This document is aimed at developers, however, the use cases and project descriptions do provide a high level
description of the project.

\subsection{Document Conventions}

In this document requirements start are labeled in the following format REQ-\#  where ``\#'' is a number.
The number in the requirement may be followed by a ``.'' and another number giving the requirement the form
REQ-\#.\#  This form indicates that the requirement is a subrequirement of the first number in the requirement. Requirements 
can include any number of numbers and periods.

For example requirement 1 would be labeled \req{1} \,. The first
requirement derived from this requirement it would be labeled\req{1.1}
\,. The first requirement derived from \req{1.1} would be labeled \req{1.1.1} \,. The number of numbers reflect how deep the requirement is and the ordering reflects where a requirement was derived from.
