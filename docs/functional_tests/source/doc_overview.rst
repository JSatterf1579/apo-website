Introduction
============

This document describes the functional tests associated with the requirements in the
APO Theta Upsilon Website Project. The requirement numbers match the requirement numbers
in the latest version fo the Software Requirements Specification Document.

Testing Requirements
--------------------

In order for the website to be deemed fully functional all tests must match the expected outcome.
The percentage of the project completed will be judged based on the percentage of these tests that pass.

If 50% of the tests in this document pass then the project is 50% complete.

Document Conventions
--------------------

Each of the tests assumes that the test will be performed on a clean instance of the code. The
test instance will also include a basic test database initialized to have a a default admin user, and 
a default member user. These accounts will be used in the testing.

Additional information will also be present in the test database, such as service events, contract types,
roles, and photos.
